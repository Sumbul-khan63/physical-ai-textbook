# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Curriculum Alignment
The textbook strictly follows the official Hackathon I: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course outline, including Physical AI and embodied intelligence, ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system, simulation and digital twins using Gazebo, AI-powered robot perception using NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for conversational robotics. No modules outside the provided curriculum are introduced in Phase 1.

### Pedagogical Excellence
Content follows concept-first learning before tools and hardware, provides clear explanations in simple English, maintains minimal mathematical complexity, focuses on intuition and system-level understanding, and implements progressive difficulty aligned with course modules.

### Target Audience Accessibility
Content is designed for undergraduate and early graduate students, AI and computer science learners, software developers transitioning into robotics, and beginners in humanoid robotics. No prior robotics hardware experience is assumed.

### Phase-Based Development
Phase 1 focuses exclusively on theoretical and conceptual understanding including core concepts of Physical AI, software architectures and simulation, and high-level understanding of humanoid robotics systems. Hands-on hardware labs, deployment, authentication systems, and RAG chatbots are intentionally excluded from Phase 1 and reserved for later phases.

### Quality and Integrity
All content remains aligned with the official hackathon PDF, avoids hallucinated hardware instructions, maintains educational clarity and consistency, and is suitable for academic and professional learning.

### AI-Assisted Creation
This textbook is created using AI-assisted writing tools (Qwen via Spec-Kit Plus). AI is used to generate structured educational content, while humans define scope, structure, validation, and alignment with the official curriculum.

## Purpose and Vision
The purpose of this textbook is to teach Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics as defined in the Hackathon I curriculum. The book focuses on AI systems operating in the physical world, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and embodied robotic systems. The textbook is designed to support Panaversity's vision of AI-native education and prepares learners for future roles where humans, AI agents, and robots collaborate.

## Success Criteria
The textbook is considered successful if: All official modules are covered, content is clearly structured and readable, the book runs correctly in Docusaurus, and the material supports future AI-native extensions.

## Governance
This constitution governs the development of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. All content and development activities must align with the principles outlined herein. Amendments to this constitution require explicit approval and documentation of changes. Version 1.0.0 of this constitution is effective upon ratification.
