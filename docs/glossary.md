# Glossary

This glossary contains key terms and definitions used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

### Action Component
The part of a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system responsible for executing physical tasks in the real world through robotic manipulation or navigation.

### Accessibility Compliance
Standards and practices that ensure the textbook content is accessible to users with diverse abilities and needs.

## B

### Biological Nervous System
The natural system in living organisms that coordinates body functions and enables interaction with the environment, used as a metaphor for ROS 2.

## C

### Closed-Loop Control
A control system where the robot's actions influence its sensory input, creating a continuous feedback loop.

### Communication Patterns
Different methods for information exchange between ROS 2 nodes, including topics, services, and actions.

### Conceptual Equation
A mathematical representation that describes relationships between abstract concepts in robotics and AI.

### Conversational Robotics
A field that focuses on enabling robots to engage in natural, multi-turn dialogues while perceiving their environment and taking appropriate actions.

## D

### Digital Twin
A virtual replica of a physical system that mirrors its properties, behaviors, and states in real-time, enabling testing and optimization without risk to the physical system.

### Digital AI
AI systems that operate primarily in the digital realm, processing digital data without direct physical interaction.

### Domain Randomization
A technique in simulation that trains AI systems with varied parameters to improve robustness to real-world variations.

## E

### Embodied Intelligence
The concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, its environment, and its cognitive processes.

### Embodied Cognition
The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the physical world.

## F

### Functional Requirements
Specific, verifiable capabilities that the textbook must provide to meet its educational objectives.

## H

### Hardware Setup Guides
Instructions for configuring physical devices and equipment (excluded from this textbook per requirements).

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study and implementation of interactions between humans and robots, focusing on making these interactions natural and effective.

## L

### Learning Objectives
Clear statements that define what students should be able to do after completing a section or module.

## M

### Mermaid Diagrams
A diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

## N

### Nodes
Individual programs or processes in ROS 2 that perform specific functions within a robotic system.

## P

### Perception-Action Loop
The continuous cycle in Physical AI systems where the system senses the environment, processes information, makes decisions, and acts upon the physical world.

### Physical AI
AI systems designed to interact directly with the physical world, not just process digital information.

### Physical Constraints
Limitations imposed by the laws of physics that Physical AI systems must comply with, such as gravity, friction, and momentum.

### Practice Questions
Interactive assessments designed to test understanding of key concepts.

## R

### Real-Time Operation
The requirement for Physical AI systems to operate within strict timing constraints, requiring timely responses to environmental changes.

### Requirements
Specifications that define what the textbook must provide to meet its educational objectives.

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
A middleware framework that facilitates communication between different software components in a robotic system.

### ROS 2 Nervous System Metaphor
The conceptual approach of viewing ROS 2 as the communication and coordination framework that connects different parts of a robot, similar to a biological nervous system.

## S

### Sensory Integration
The process by which Physical AI systems must process information from diverse sensor types simultaneously.

### Simulation
The creation of virtual environments that model the physical world, allowing robotic systems and their algorithms to be tested without requiring physical hardware.

### Sequential Dependency Structure
The organization of content where chapters build upon each other sequentially, with each chapter building foundational knowledge for the next.

### Success Criteria
Measurable outcomes that determine whether the textbook successfully meets its educational objectives.

## T

### Topics (in ROS 2)
Named channels through which data flows between nodes in a publish-subscribe model.

## V

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
Integrated AI systems that combine visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action to enable natural human-robot interaction.

## W

### Why Physical AI Matters
Key reasons why Physical AI is important: real-world impact, embodied cognition, natural human-robot interaction, and robustness through adaptation.
